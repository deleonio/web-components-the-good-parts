# Web Components - The good parts

With the help of the **Web Component** standard of the **W3C** it has been possible to create **custom HTML elements** since **2014**. However, due to the **lack of** comprehensive **browser support**, **Web Components** had a hard time asserting themselves for a long time.

Thanks to **Microsoft**, **2021** will turn the tide and the web component standard can finally show what it's made of. With the **Good Part** we show how **powerful** Web Components are, how to use them **properly** and which cool **features** are still waiting for us.
